OBJECTIVES
The main goal of this project is to develop a Java application that meets the requirements expressed
in the following pages, while exploiting the concepts and competencies learnt in the course.
TARGETED SKILLS
In this project, we aim to exploit the following competencies; knowing that the assessment will be
an evaluation of the degree of attainment of these competencies:
• Design an extensible software application following a proper scientific approach.
• Apply, using the Java programming language, the following concepts:
o Object Oriented Programming
o Proper design and use of classes and class associations (including choice of static
attributes and methods, visibility levels and encapsulation)
o Proper use of inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and interfaces
o Use of collections, input/output in Java
INSTRUCTIONS
1. The project must be worked on individually.
2. Adopt proper error handling and data validations.
3. Plagiarism will not be tolerated!
4. Customizing the application is allowed as long as it fulfills the main objective and aligns with
the above-mentioned competencies.
5. Importing external libraries is required to manipulate data from and to different formats
(serialization and deserialization).
6. Notes on your submissions:
6.1. The date of the defense is to be fixed by the teacher.
6.2. You must send submit the project to the e-courses platform: it will be composed of the
following files:
6.2.1. The compressed project file (ZIP / RAR)
6.2.2. A JavaDoc (Click here for details on how to generate one from your code)
6.2.3. A report detailing the execution steps of the project including screenshots of the
results. The choices must be validated without copying the course content / extracting
online reference. The code must not be copied in this report.
6.3. Sending by e-mail will not be accepted.
6.4. No projects shall be accepted after the deadline.
6.5. In case the project exceeds the size limit that is accepted on e-courses, you can in this case
only submit a single file through e-courses containing a link to [Dropbox / WeTransfer /
Google Drive / ...] where you must place all the files mentioned in points 6.2.1 till 6.2.3.

DESCRIPTION
Text messaging, or texting, is the act of composing and sending electronic messages, typically
consisting of alphabetic and numeric characters, between two or more users of mobile devices,
desktops/laptops, or another type of compatible computer. Text messages may be sent over a cellular
network, or may also be sent via an Internet connection.
A Chat server is a software system that is designed to handle direct communication between persons.
Normally, the chat process works on a client-server networking model.
Our aim at this stage is to develop a simple messaging system that uses MongoDB to store data and
to read messages between users and would work as an instant messaging system.
A text message in this system would have the following attributes:
1. the text message
2. the sender
3. the recipient
4. the read status
OBJECTIVES
1. Develop the user protocol (in the command line) to allow the user to send and receive instant
messages.
2. Develop the core of the application, which consists of the main program and a set of classes to
group the data.
3. Develop an abstraction layer, which includes the set of classes and interfaces that make the
application independent from the source of the data.
Bonus
• Try to add the functionality of displaying emoticons in the console. You can find fonts that have
characters displayed as emoticons. So your objective is to translate the text sent by a user into the
characters of the corresponding fonts.
No Luck, Just Skills!
